# ML_TitanicSurvivalExploration
Created as part of the Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree.

Explore a subset of the Titanic passenger manifest to determine which features best predict whether someone survived or did not survive.

The ML_TitanicSurvivalExploration is an educational project; its purposes is to illustrate the theory behind the operation of a machine learning classification algorithms.
The project consists of a jupyter notebook, some auxiliary code and an HTML file (notebook HTML representation.)
The project was coded in python 2.6.
The source data of the project is also in the repository.

I learned two fundamental techniques of Machine Learning during the execution of this project. The first one was the used of jupyter notebook and a method to explore data using python's pandas and numpy modules; the second was the method to study the data's properties to create useful classification models from them.
